For Renan Viana’s micro characters (@encolhiaspessoas), it’s gigantic. In 2014, the 28-year-old photographer found a box of miniature figures in an antique shop in Belém, Brazil. Renan customized each with paint, glaze and glue then started taking photos of them on wild adventures. “The miniature figures are my companions to discover new places,” he says. “I carry a few around in a little box, and whenever I go out, I set up scenes on my walks. But I plan more specific scenes in advance.”\n“Taking pictures of such little ‘people’ on the street draws a lot of attention,” says Renan. “Some people pass by without understanding what I’m doing, while others stop and get closer until they realize what’s going on. Once I had to cover a figure with my hand so that it wasn’t crushed. I ended up hurting my hand, but the figure was OK.”\nTune in to today’s story to learn more about Renan’s characters and their world.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/857861b9d118bad7c191ba5ac6ea29e0/5B1B664D/t51.2885-15/e35/27579999_160421831281432_7966438815319457792_n.jpg"},

Here are some tips:\nPlay with scale and move around to find new perspectives within a single frame. For example, photographing a puddle low to the ground can turn it into an ocean.\nLet props help. A cleverly placed mirror or some sleight-of-hand card tricks can elevate a simple illusion to double take-worthy.\nMake magic by playing with both artificial and natural light. Use a flashlight to draw the eye toward a specific element of an image or incorporate the setting sun’s long shadows into your illusion.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPillusion hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Or there’s the thrill, focus and nausea-inducing fear of being hundreds of feet up a wall, unsure of the next climbing move, and looking at a big fall onto your last piece of protection.”\nFor Tim, strenuous conditions offer relief from the stresses of his documentary projects in urban environments, investigating hard subjects ranging from human trafficking, sex work and youth homelessness. “The outdoors is balance. I love the problem-solving, the risk management, the clarity that comes from being on the edge.

It’s about gathering knowledge and experience and going deeper. So, for me, ice cream is about flavor, and it’s about conversation and getting to know someone else better. My favorite part of my job is scooping ice cream and helping people find a flavor that inspires them and the conversation that unfolds.”\nShe’s based in Columbus, Ohio, but Jeni is often on the road to visit her scoop shops all over the country— and she loves what she’s seeing. “The maker and entrepreneur movement is a massive tsunami.

Look at the frame from many angles to find the most compelling one.\nFocus on the textures and details of a window — the curve of old glass, the modern metal latches or eye-catching figurines on the windowsill.\nStep back from the window to get a sense of scale. Notice how sets of windows fit together, emphasizing both the functionality and fragility of their design, or focus on the structure of the walls surrounding them.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPwindows hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Paola Antonelli (@paolantonelli), senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA, shared these tips for getting started with your submission:\nThink about the role fashion plays in your life — and capture it in an image. “The way we dress tells us so much about our identities and selves, as well as larger histories or stories of place and community,” says Paola. “Clothing can be armor, disguise or representation of true selfhood.”\nFocus on specific items in your closet you’d like to highlight: “Pick something you love, that you truly adore and feel happy in,” says Paola. “Find out more about its story before you take your picture. Where did it come from? Who might have made it? How much did it cost you? How do you take care of it? And then strike a pose.”\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmystyle hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f9b3ffe78af30593c99c8fb7960c83d8/5B0A34AE/t51.2885-15/e35/26066352_176439989773928_2800259552472203264_n.jpg"},

Here are some tips to get you started:\nHead outside to see what stripes nature has to offer, like the natural lines of your local flora or the way streams create bands through a landscape.\nFrom repeating red lockers in the hallway to the way office buildings cast shadows at high noon, there are plenty of stripes in your daily life. Try to notice them — along with the lines created by highways and streets on your commute to and from.\nWide or narrow, straight or curving, stripes are a classic element in art — from fashion to painting to DIY crafts. Take photos of work that explores the many forms that stripes can take.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPstripes hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

I’ve been Fuzzy to everyone I know since,” says the volunteer who is licensed by New York State to rescue and rehabilitate wildlife. “A fawn that is sickly has a fuzzy coat, so after all of these years being called Fuzzy, my name finally fit!” Six years ago, a deer who had been struck by a car entered Fuzzy’s yard. “Long story short, it took me four hours to find help for this deer that was suffering. I wasn’t going to allow that to happen again.” The very next day, she set out on a path to help these animals in need. “Life at Fuzzy Fawn is hectic, sad, happy and fun,” says Fuzzy, who received nearly 400 calls from people seeking help this fawn season. “Instagram has been a tremendous help. I’ve been able to reach out to other rehabbers in different states, we bounce ideas back and forth about treatments for the wildlife in our care.” Watch our story to see more of what life is like for Fuzzy and her family of fawns.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/56d5189816af314237fc2515e866c1c6/5A7F0F28/t51.2885-15/e15/25009156_135146843843386_3301482214440566784_n.jpg"},

Stories Highlights is a new part of your profile where you can show more of who you are through stories you’ve shared. And to help you build highlights, your stories will now automatically save into a private Stories Archive so you can easily relive them.\nNow you can group stories into highlights and feature them on your profile. To create a highlight, tap the “New” circle, choose stories from your archive, select a cover and give it a name. Your highlight will appear as a circle on your profile that can be played as a stand-alone story.\nMoving forward, your stories will automatically save to your Stories Archive. To see yours, tap the archive icon on your profile, then tap on any story to watch it. From there, you can add it to your current story, share it as a post or add it to a highlight on your profile. Only you can see your archived stories, and you can turn off auto-archiving at any time in your profile settings.\nTo learn more about Stories Highlights and Stories Archive, check out help.instagram.com. Today’s updates are available as part of Instagram version 25 on iOS and Android.\nVideo by @yelldesign","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ac69f4d74a78c469b723e8cc5b8e90d6/5A7E8831/t51.2885-15/e15/24332004_166792800591413_5647372164442095616_n.jpg"},

A decade ago, Elaine reached out to the then editor-in-chief of Ebony magazine for an informational phone call. “That call was the singular tipping point for the life I’m living today,” says Elaine, who has spent the past five years at Teen Vogue (@teenvogue), most recently as the magazine’s youngest editor-in-chief. “She hired me on the spot and whisked me off to start my professional life in magazines in New York City.”\nToday, Elaine is a mentor to young women both in person and on social media. “Showing up in my career every day as my full authentic self is key,” she says. “I share certain parts of my life that young girls can relate to because it is important for them to see themselves in women who are placed in positions of power, without having to sacrifice or hide or disguise certain parts of who they are. I think that’s an important message for young girls who are still figuring out their own identity and dreams.”\nThis weekend, Elaine is at the first-ever #TeenVogueSummit in Los Angeles, inspiring and enabling young women to achieve their career goals.

Two years ago, when he was restless on a family vacation, the now 17-year-old from Busswil, Switzerland, picked up a camera for the first time. During the week, he’s a commercial banking apprentice but when the weekend rolls around, he always has his camera in tow. “It is always a new adventure, and I am always impressed with how beautiful nature is,” says Fabio, who is particularly fascinated with playing with range. “The larger a mountain appears and the smaller the person is, the more it becomes clear how small we truly are.”\nExplore the Swiss mountain town St. Moritz with Fabio on our Instagram story right now. ⛰","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a7891222db434e7e24dbb173f8141c7c/5AFF9290/t51.2885-15/e35/22277538_1987368801539992_4665344475080425472_n.jpg"},

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos capturing the signs of a new season, as in this featured photo from Daniel Taipale (@dansmoe). Here are some tips to get you started: \nWhether you’re in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern, nature transforms the landscape this time of year. Head outside to seek inspiration in your surroundings — from the fiery reds and oranges of fall to the bright greens and blues of spring.\nWhat are your favorite activities in the upcoming season? Show us how you welcome the new season through traditions like autumn pumpkin-carving or planting a new garden.\nReflect on what other transitions are taking place in your life, from new classes to new sports seasons.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPseasons hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.","media":"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/657ac90ecbcbedbd1249594f2eafc98b/5B1B1489/t51.2885-15/e35/22159217_630424707345112_2466181938033983488_n.jpg"},
